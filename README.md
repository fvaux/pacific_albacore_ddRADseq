# albacore_STACKS_and_filtering
Lists input commands used for STACSK and BWA, and subsequent filtering in VCFtools, plink, and paralog-finder (HDplot).

# maps
Maps used to select individuals and populations in STACKS runs.

# blacklists
Blacklists used to exclude certain loci in STACKS runs.

# plink-ld
